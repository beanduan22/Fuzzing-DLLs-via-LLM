# Fuzzing_DLLs_via_LLM
This is main source code of MALFuzz for fuzz testing PyTorch and TensorFlow.

Since the paper has not been accepted yet, we only show part of our key code and the model generated by GPT-4 here.\

The Fuzzing folder is divided into two files, one for fuzzing Pytorch and one for fuzzing Tensorflow.

You need to install pytorch (v2.1) and tensorflow (v2.13) to run

under /Fuzzing/torch

You can find some of our work: the classification file classfied_api based on pytorch classification, which contains the classified pytorch API. The Fuzzing4model.py file is the program we implemented to fuzz model. After instantiating it, it can be called after obtaining the model and model input. In order to facilitate calling, we have included multiple bug-generating models in the model_torch folder. In addition, the example_model_generatedbygpt_1_labeled.py file under the file of model_labeled is the model that is inserted into checkpoints by GPT again after an error occurs in the example_model_generatedbygpt_1.py file. The roundpickup_apis.py file is a file where we randomly select API groups.

If you want to run it, you only need to create a file, instantiate Fuzzing4model, and call the model under model_torch.

In addition, we also attach the reported and comfired bugs

And bugs we reported and comfirmed is shown in the Fuzzing/Torch/torch.csv and Fuzzing/TF/tf.csv
