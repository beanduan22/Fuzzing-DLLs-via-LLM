# SnakeFuzz
This is main source code of SnakeFuzz for fuzz testing PyTorch and TensorFlow.

Since the paper has not been accepted yet, we only show part of our key code and the model generated by GPT-4 here.

The Fuzzing folder have two files, one for Pytorch and other for Tensorflow.

You need to install pytorch (v2.1) and tensorflow (v2.13) to run

You can find some of our work: the classification file classfied_api based on pytorch classification, which contains the classified pytorch API. 
The Fuzzing4model.py file is the program we implemented to fuzz model. After instantiating it, it can be called after obtaining the model and model input.

If you want to run it, you only need to create a file, instantiate Fuzzing4model, and call the model under model_torch.

In addition, we have not include the reported and comfired bugs, because they might reveal the authors identities.
